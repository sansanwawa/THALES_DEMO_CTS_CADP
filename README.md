# WARNING : THIS APPLICATION IS FOR DEMO PURPOSE RELATED ON CTS AND CADP

This is a simple demo app for CTS and CADP.

How to populate in your IDE (IntelliJ) :

1. Create the project 
2. Copy manually in your workspace

How to run : 

1. Rename the "start.txt" and "stop.txt" into "start.bat" and "stop.bat", change all into "*.bat" file
2. Run the "start.bat" file
3. See the console is displaying a few lines of logs
4. If you see the LAST text is "[com.thales.id.jakarta.App] - Started App in xxxxx seconds (JVM running for xxxxx)", that mean the app is already running.
5. Navigate your browser to "https://localhost:8282"
6. You will see the menu for "CTS" and "CADP"
7. You can close the cmd windows to stop the application
8. If you have any problem during stoping the application, you can run the file "stop.bat"

Thank you
